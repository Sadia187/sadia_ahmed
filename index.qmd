# Welcome to my website!

I am a microbiologist specializing in probiotics, postbiotics, and their role in human health. I have a strong foundation in microbial biotechnology as well as inflammatory and immune-related diseases through my academic training and research experiences.

I have worked at the National Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering (NIBGE) in Pakistan and am currently part of the Department of Dermatology at Case Western Reserve University. During my PhD, I investigated the therapeutic effects of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease, focusing on their safety, functional mechanisms, and ability to modulate host immunity.

My current research explores host–microbe interactions with an emphasis on the immunomodulatory potential of probiotics and their application in antifungal drug development. I am particularly interested in identifying microbe-derived molecules that can influence immune responses and contribute to novel therapeutic strategies.

My professional goal is to advance innovative microbiome-based approaches that improve health outcomes and support those living with chronic inflammatory conditions. On this site, you’ll find my publications. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:sxa1195@case.edu) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
