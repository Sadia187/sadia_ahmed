Current treatments mainly focus on suppressing inflammation, but severe cases often require surgery. Alterations in the gut microbiome are strongly linked to CD, especially the presence of bacteria within cavitating fistulous microlesions (CavFT) in the gut wall, which exacerbate inflammation and tissue damage."

My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

We evaluate both microbial and histopathological outcomes to assess probiotic efficacy in modulating disease severity."
